-p_parameter(Kp__): when it's very small the response was slow. higher means faster response but still get error.
-i_parameter(Ki__): it's important to decrease the error but with higher value get overshoot so the car move in zigzag way.
-d_parameter(Kd__): it's main advantage is to reduce the overshoot. when I have defined it flase (as in the note below), the overshoot was there causing the car car to move in zigzag and then get out of the road.


I have used only the parameters and tried to tune them manually, and here's my outcome: 
Kp__ = 0.2;
Ki__ = 0.007;
Kd__ = 12.0; 

the errors are:
d_error = cte - p_error;
p_error = cte;
i_error += cte;

Note:
at the first I have mistakenly defined the d_error after p_error, this means d_error=cte-cte=0, then I got an overshoot whith every road curve. when I corrected it, the controller worked very well

- I used the error correction to control the steering angle.
- also I have used it to control the throttle in order to limit the acceleration of the car as possible
